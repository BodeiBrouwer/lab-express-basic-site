    <h1>About her</h1>
    <div>
    <p> Jane Goodall set out to Tanzania in 1960 to study wild chimpanzees. 
        She immersed herself in their lives, bypassing more rigid procedures to make discoveries about primate behavior that have continued to shape scientific discourse. 
        A highly respected member of the world scientific community, she advocates for ecological preservation through the Jane Goodall Institute.</p>
